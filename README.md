# CIFAR-10 Image Classification with MLP

This notebook demonstrates image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset using a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). It explores different hyperparameter combinations to find the best performing model.

**Key Features:**

- Loading and preprocessing the CIFAR-10 dataset.
- Visualizing sample images.
- Building and training MLP models with varying architectures and optimizers.
- Evaluating model performance.
- Identifying the best performing model based on test accuracy.

**Conclusion:**

The MLP achieved a maximum accuracy of 0.5016. For better performance on image data, consider using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
